        projectDesc: "Welcome to our office that exudes the fresh image of la belle vie Inc., a new company born from the merger of the flash sale e-commerce sites GLADD and GILT. La belle vie means “a beautiful life”, and through our business we showcase the value of true-quality items selected from the plethora of global products and brands on offer.To convey this image, we have designed an office space modelled on a simple beauty that is expressed in the understated elegance of the materials used.",
        projectDesc2: "The all-glass partitions in the entrance waiting area create a sense of openness by offering a continual view through to the office area. Visitors can see for themselves how the office environment looks and feels, and naturally get a sense of what it’s like to work here. As the office is split over two floors, we were faced with the challenge of how to encourage the staff on each floor to communicate with each other; the solution was to create open spaces where people can work freely outside of the designated office areas. These free spaces overlook the Akasaka-Goyochi Imperial Grounds, providing sweeping views of the greenery below through long landscape-oriented windows that lets you feel the refreshment of being outdoors while still working indoors. The versatile furniture arranged throughout the area offers enough privacy for working alone, as well as sufficient space for holding briefings and an environment that makes communicating with others easy. The furniture is made from materials with a striking yet understated elegance and in natural tones, which combine to create a fluid-style office that does not lend itself to any set image.",
